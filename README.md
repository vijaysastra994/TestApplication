Album Application
-----------------------------

This is a sample Android application to load Albums list from web service. https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/

Application architecture and technical details
-------------------------------------------------------

•	Using MVVM architecture

•	Uses Kotlin as the programming language

•	Uses Retrofit for retrieving data from the web service

•	Uses Repository Pattern for transparent access of data to the view layer

Dependencies - used technologies and Practices: 
-------------------------------------------------------------

•	CLEAN Architucture - Architectures allow decoupling different units of your code in an organized manner. That way the code gets easier to understand, modify and test.

•	MVVM - MVVM architecture is a Model-View-ViewModel architecture that removes the tight coupling between each component.

•	Coroutines - A coroutine is a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously.

•	Room - Room is an ORM (object relational mapper) for SQLite database in Android

•	FastAdapter - The FastAdapter is here to simplify creating adapters for RecyclerViews

•	Junit5 - Unit tests are the fundamental tests in your app testing strategy

•	Dagger2 - Static, compile-time, annotation based dependency injection for Android.

•	Retrofit2 - REST Client for Android and Java.

•	Okhttp3 Logging Interceptor - An OkHttp interceptor which logs HTTP request and response data (used with Retrofit).

•	Gson - To convert Java objects to JSON and back (used with Retrofit).

•	Constraint Layout - Building complex responsive layouts with performance efficiency.

•	RecyclerView - Much better list.
